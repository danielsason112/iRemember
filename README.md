    A simple Matching Pairs game app for ios devices. On each turn, the player clicks and flips a pair of cards, if their image is the same, it's a match and the
    two cards remains revealed. When the player matches the last pair, the game ends. The timer starts on the first card flip, and the goal is to match all of the pairs at the
    fastest time. The app uses the location service for storing the player's location on the high scores table. High scores are stored on the device, using UserDefaults.
